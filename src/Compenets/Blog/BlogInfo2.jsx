    Jesus Is the Way
        In John 14:6, Jesus declared, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me." These words are both an invitation and a profound truth that has echoed through the centuries.
        When Jesus says He is "the way," He is showing us that He is the bridge between humanity and God. In a world often filled with confusion, sin, and brokenness, Jesus offers a clear path to reconciliation with the Father. He doesn’t just point us to the way; He is the way—through His life, death, and resurrection.
        This truth is transformative. Jesus isn’t merely one option among many; He is the only way to eternal life (Acts 4:12). His sacrifice on the cross paid the debt for our sins, and His resurrection triumphed over death, ensuring that we can live in fellowship with God forever.
