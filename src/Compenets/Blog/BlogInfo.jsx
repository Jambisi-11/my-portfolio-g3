  Don't Perish – A Call to Eternal Hope
 In John 3:16, we find one of the most profound promises of the Bible: "For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life."
The word "perish" here speaks not merely of physical death but of eternal separation from God—the ultimate loss. Yet, through Jesus Christ, God has made a way for us to avoid this fate and enter into eternal joy, peace, and fellowship with Him.
God’s desire is that no one should perish (2 Peter 3:9). His love reaches out to every person, offering the gift of salvation through faith in His Son. This isn’t about earning God’s favor but about receiving His grace—a grace that transforms our lives, restores our relationship with Him, and gives us hope beyond this world.
To "not perish" is to embrace the life God offers—a life marked by love, forgiveness, purpose, and the assurance of eternity in His presence. It’s a call to turn from sin and choose the path of life (Deuteronomy 30:19), trusting in the One who conquered death on our behalf.
today, let this be a reminder: God’s arms are open wide. He calls you to live, not just for today, but for eternity. Choose Him, trust Him, and walk in the abundant life He has prepared for you.

   Jesus Is the Way
In John 14:6, Jesus declared, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me." These words are both an invitation and a profound truth that has echoed through the centuries.
When Jesus says He is "the way," He is showing us that He is the bridge between humanity and God. In a world often filled with confusion, sin, and brokenness, Jesus offers a clear path to reconciliation with the Father. He doesn’t just point us to the way; He is the way—through His life, death, and resurrection.
This truth is transformative. Jesus isn’t merely one option among many; He is the only way to eternal life (Acts 4:12). His sacrifice on the cross paid the debt for our sins, and His resurrection triumphed over death, ensuring that we can live in fellowship with God forever.       </p>

    As believers, our faith journey doesn’t end when we accept Jesus as Lord and Savior—it begins. Just as a seed planted in good soil is meant to grow and bear fruit, so are we called to grow in Christ. The Apostle Peter encourages us in 2 Peter 3:18, “But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be glory both now and forever! Amen.”
 Growing in Jesus means becoming more like Him every day. It’s about deepening our relationship with Him, allowing His Word and Spirit to transform our hearts and minds. This growth isn’t instantaneous—it’s a lifelong process, marked by small, faithful steps of obedience and surrender.
Growing in Jesus is not about striving in our own strength but relying on His grace. Philippians 1:6 reminds us that “He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.” Our growth is His work, and He is faithful to see it through.
So, let’s commit to grow in Him—to seek Him daily, to trust Him fully, and to live for His glory. As we do, we’ll not only experience the fullness of life He promises but also become a light to those around us, pointing them to the Savior who transforms lives.

     In John 15:5, Jesus declares, “I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me, you can do nothing.” These words reveal a profound truth about the Christian life: our spiritual vitality, growth, and fruitfulness come only through abiding in Jesus.
 The image of the vine and branches paints a picture of intimacy, dependence, and connection. Just as a branch cannot survive or produce fruit apart from the vine, we cannot thrive spiritually without a close relationship with Christ. To abide in Him means to remain steadfastly connected to Him, drawing our strength, guidance, and purpose from Him.
 When we abide in Christ, His life flows through us. We experience His peace in trials, His strength in weakness, and His joy in all circumstances. Abiding transforms our relationship with God from religion into a vibrant, life-giving connection.
 But Jesus also gives a sobering reminder: “Apart from me, you can do nothing.” When we attempt to live apart from Christ, we wither spiritually, unable to bear fruit or fulfill the purpose He has for us. Abiding in Him is not optional; it is essential for a flourishing Christian life.
 Jesus invites each of us to abide in Him daily. This is not about striving in our own strength but about resting in His grace, trusting in His promises, and walking in step with His Spirit.
 As we abide in Christ the Vine, we will not only bear much fruit for His glory but also experience the fullness of life He has promised (John 10:10). Let us remain steadfastly connected to Him, knowing that He is our source, our sustainer, and our Savior.

     As Christians, we are called to live with an eternal perspective. The Apostle Paul reminds us in 2 Corinthians 4:18, “So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.” This verse challenges us to look beyond the fleeting realities of this world and focus on the lasting hope of eternity with Christ.
     Living with eternity in view doesn’t mean neglecting the present; it means living with purpose, hope, and faith that extend beyond this world. It is a life anchored in the reality of God’s promises and the assurance of His eternal love.
 As we live with eternity in view, we can echo the words of Paul: “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day” (2 Timothy 4:7-8).
 Let us live each day with eternity in our hearts, bringing glory to God and pointing others to the everlasting hope we have in Christ.
